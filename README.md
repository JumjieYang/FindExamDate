# FindExamDate
This tool is to help to find your exam date at McGill University without opening your browser

Since the script is writing by Python3, you may need to install Python3 on your machine

After installing Python, in order to use it, first install a library called tabula-py

You can install it by typing:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

In order to make the script running, you also need to install java with at least version 8 on your machine.

## Update

You can now only download exam.csv and reader.py to make the script running
